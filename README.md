# Robotis_Mini_Python

## What's this project about?
This is a python only version of my Robotis_Mini_ROS project. 

I've had a lot of trouble with communication in the ROS version of this project so I decided to, once again, start from scratch. This time my goal is to make communication between the pi and the OpenCM9.04 rock-solid. If this works, I can go back to the ROS project and continue working on it.

For more information regarding the ROS project, please check the readme file from the [ROS branch](https://github.com/Benoit-LdL/Robotis_Mini_ROS).

## What is the goal of this project?
**A.** Create a stable and fast connection between the Raspberry Pi and the openCM9.04.

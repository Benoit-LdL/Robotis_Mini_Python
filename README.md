# Robotis_Mini_Python

## What's this project about?
This is a python only version of my Robotis_Mini_ROS project. 

I've had a lot of trouble with communication in the ROS version of this project so I decided to, once again, start from scratch. This time my goal is to make communication between the pi and the OpenCM9.04 rock-solid. In parallel I wil try out the Klamp't library which I've used for another project.

- My Robotis Mini ROS repository: [ROS repo](https://github.com/Benoit-LdL/Robotis_Mini_ROS).

- The Klamp't library [repo](https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt) and [docs](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/Manual.html)

## What is the goal of this project?
**A.** Create a stable and fast connection between the Raspberry Pi and the openCM9.04. 

**B.** Create a virtual environment in which I can test Inverse Kinematics, motion planning, etc
